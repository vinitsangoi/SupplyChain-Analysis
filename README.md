# Description :- 
* This is a SupplyChain SQL Project.
* Orderlist table has 9000 rows.
* In this project, Hardi Jain & Vinit Sangoi worked together.
* In this case study, the company wanted to analysis its logistics & make informed business decisions
* Dataset is divided into 7 tables, one table for all orders that needs to be assigned a route â€“ OrderList table, and 6 additional files specifying the problem and restrictions. 

# Methodology :- 
* The first step we took was understanding the data, as the dataset contains 7 tables. 
* We understood each table & build a data model. Creating a data model of 7 tables using primary & foreign keys. 
* After uploading the datasets on SQL, we analyzed companies supply chain. 
* We used various SQL functions & commands like self-join, sub queries, joins, views, multiple joins, etc.

# Analysis :-
* We analyzed Top 50 products by orders
* Total cost incurred at each plant
* Plants which are operating at over-capacity
* Product with total orders & quantity
* Average transport day count 
* Total rate of each port & many more.

# Results :-
* By getting a better understanding of markets through supply chain analytics, the business can find opportunities to grow revenue. 
* Through analytics, both descriptive and predictive, supply chain risks are identified, and appropriate measures are taken. 
* The company can also monitor its own ability to deliver items on time to customers or eliminate stock-outs by better inventory planning
